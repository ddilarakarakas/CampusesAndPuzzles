# CampusesAndPuzzles
To briefly talk about this game, it consists of 3 characters and 3 monsters. Below is a tile board played to damage them. It looks like the candy crush game we know. 
There are 3 types and 3 styles of characters and monsters. Each character's unique strength, agility and health are revealed according to these type and style combinations. This shows us that there are 9 different combinations.
